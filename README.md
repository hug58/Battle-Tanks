## Multiplayer

<p> I wanted to create a game that was multiplayer but not limited to a single pc, that is, to create a socket that would transmit status information from one player to the other (lan network if you prefer), and the result is quite good. </p> 
  
  <p> The socket works by receiving the Player class from the other players, while updating all the attributes of those players. 
   A player can only send the object of the corresponding class, so there must be a minimum of 2 players for there to be an exchange of information.<p>
